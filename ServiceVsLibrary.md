When deciding how to provide data from a database to multiple services, you essentially have two main approaches: creating a dedicated service to return data (often called a data service or API) or using a shared library that can be directly utilized by the applications to access database data. Here's a comparison of these two approaches in a table format:

| Factor                   | Data Service/API                                          | Shared Library                                  |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Coupling**             | Loose coupling; changes in the data service don't directly affect consumers. | Tight coupling; changes in the library require updates in all dependent services. |
| **Maintenance**          | Centralized maintenance; updates are made in one place.   | Distributed maintenance; each service might require individual updates. |
| **Scalability**          | Easier to scale the service independently based on demand. | Scalability is dependent on each application's architecture. |
| **Performance**          | Network calls may introduce latency.                      | Direct access to DB could be faster but depends on implementation. |
| **Consistency & Control**| Easier to enforce data consistency and access policies.    | Requires careful implementation to maintain consistency across services. |
| **Deployment**           | Independent deployment; can be updated without deploying consumer services. | Requires redeployment of all services using the library for updates. |
| **Ease of Use**          | Requires network calls, serialization/deserialization.    | Direct method calls, potentially more straightforward to use. |
| **Security**             | Easier to secure one endpoint than multiple application databases. | Security must be handled individually in each service. |
| **Testing**              | Can be tested independently of consumers.                 | Requires integrated testing with each service. |
| **Reuse**                | API can be reused by different types of clients (web, mobile, etc.). | Limited to services within the same technology stack. |

### Suggested Solution:

Considering the factors above, a **data service or API** is generally a more flexible and scalable solution, particularly for systems where multiple services with potentially different technology stacks need to access the data. This approach allows for better control over data access, easier maintenance, and more straightforward scalability and security implementations.

A data service can serve as a single source of truth for your data, ensuring consistency across different services. It also allows for independent scaling and updating without impacting the consuming services. Additionally, implementing security measures like authentication and authorization is generally more straightforward with a single data endpoint.

In contrast, a shared library might be more suitable in scenarios where performance is critical, and the added network latency of a data service is not acceptable. However, this approach requires more effort to ensure consistency and security across all consuming services.

Ultimately, the choice depends on your specific use case, performance requirements, and the existing architecture of your system.
